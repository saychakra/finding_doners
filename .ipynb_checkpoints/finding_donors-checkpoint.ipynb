    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Real World Application: Logistic regression solve the problem of handling non-linear values in a dataset. \n",
    "                            Some real world application of logistic regression can be stated as follows:\n",
    "                            i.  handwriting recognition\n",
    "                            ii. predicting whether a person is fit for a particular job based on certain features (his specified                                 skills)\n",
    "                            iii.geographic image processing\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Strengths: Logistic regression carefully and handles problems of non-linear data. Also the dependent variables need not be\n",
    "               normally distributed.\n",
    "               \n",
    "    Weaknesses: The decision boundaries must be linear ie. separable by a hyperplane. Otherwise the model does not work very                     well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Herein, as we can see, we have a problem which wants us to suggest whether a person would donate for the charity or not. This is a case of binary classification.\n",
    " Now, in this case, the problem is inherently unpredictable with bits and pieces of information hindering a linear/continuous predictability. In such a case the generic probabilistic approach of a logistic regression model should help in getting a proper result/prediction. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Real World Application: We can use this model to predict whether a person is a criminal or not, based on certain predefined \n",
    "                            features.\n",
    "    Stengths: In random forest each tree is trained independently, which is better than a single decision tree classification,                 which also makes it less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "              \n",
    "    Weaknesses: Gradient Boost trees (GBTs) are prone to overfitting.\n",

    "    \n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines\n",

    "    Real World Application: Support vector machines are one of the finest classification techniqus which can classify problems                               in a finely tuned manner. Some real world applications of SVMs can be face detection, handwriting                               recognition, image classification, Bioinformatics etc.\n",

    "    Strengths: (a) The separating of values based on the kernel (Kernel trick)\n",

    "               \n",
    "    Weaknesses: The theoretical definitions only suggests a major advantage of the regularization parameters, but SVMs in                       general are again quite sensitive to overfitting also the time taken for training a model on SVM is moreover to                 a major extent greater than that of any of the other models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Conclusion: Again, looking at the size of the data and features (here we are mostly concerned with the income of the                         person), I think, logistic regression would give a better result. For the reasons mentioned above."

Since the difference between the scores of the SVM and the Logistic regression is not varied to such and extent, considering the huge major time difference between the execution of the two models, I think a Logistic Regression model would be a better fit.\n",

    "![linear_data.png](attachment:linear_data.png)\n",
    "source: google images\n",
    "\n",
    "But when the data is not distributed linearly, logistic regression comes in aid. Also Logistic regression can take any real number and map it between 0 and 1 unlike linear regression which sometimes can give values greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression in Layman's Terms**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we need an answer to the question on whether a person would donate. Say the main criterion which will help us in understanding this is his income amount ie. higher the person earns, more likely is he to donate (now this is obviously not true in practical and real life. But let us assume so in this case and proceed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Proceeding thus far, we try to implement a logistic regression model. Now what logistic regression does in general, is to use a generic probabilistic approach to come up with a value between 0 and 1 (as can be seen from the sigmoid graph). The idea is to give a rough probability depending on this value. Considering a value of 1, the model says that the person will donate and it is 100% confident, that he/she will. On the other hand, a value of 0 suggests that the person would not donate at all an the model is 100% sure that he/she will **not** donate. Correspodingly a value of 0.8 would suggest that the person is most likely to donate and the model is 80% confident, that he will donate. In general, a value above 0.5 would suggest that the person is most likely to donate, whereas a value below 0.5 would suggest that he would not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now how this is done, can be another question. Well, this can be answered in the following way:\n",
    "Here we train the model with our training data. The training data consists of features and labels. For eg. We tell the model, saying that a person with such and such features and an income above 50K (which is the independent variable here) donated (which is the dependant variable). Similarly a person who is earning at most 50K did not donate. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the training is done, we test model, with a known value from the cross-validated set. And if we are satified with the result we say that the model has done a good job in predicting. After that we can take in test values accordingly and the model would help us in predicting whether the person would donate or not, with a particular value of confidence. Say a confidence value of 0.8 (80%) is well enough to suggest that the model is working fine."

    "education_level mostly has the highest order of importance as can be seem from the visualization, which is again imeperative in determining whether a person understands the gravity of an act like donating.\n",
    "Also occupation as I had mentioned before, can be considered as a key factor for the person donating ie. an unemployed person is much less likely to donate than a person who has a fixed source of income.\n",
    "Apart from that I guess, marital status plays an important role because it determines how much a person needs to spend on their family, which completely makes sense. Like, an unmarried individual would probably be able to donate much more with a less scale of income than someone who is married."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
